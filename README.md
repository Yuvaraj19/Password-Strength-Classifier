# Password-Strength-Classifier

The software that analyzes the strength of the password to facilitate organizations launch a multi-faceted defense
against password breach and provide a highly secure environment using Machine Learning algorithms such as Naive
Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network and Decision Tree.

## Algorithms used
- Decision Trees
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes (Bernoulli Distribution Model)
- Random Forest
- Neural Network (MLP Classifier)
